		<h2 class="text-section__title">What is Work Instruction Software</h2>
		<p class="text-section__subtitle">In the past, manufacturers relied on tools like Excel, Word, or PowerPoint to create Standard Work Instructions. While useful at the time, these platforms fall short of today's standards. Work Instruction Software is purpose-built for manufacturing, significantly reducing the time required to develop and maintain Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). While paper-based work instructions remain an option, transitioning to digital work instructions offers unparalleled benefits. By providing Operators with computer-based access to work instructions, you unlock 24/7 time studies, seamless in-line quality assurance, and precise product tracing.</p>
